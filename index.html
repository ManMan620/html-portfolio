    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>The summary of my life coding career starts when i was a freshman in highschool.</p>
    <p>I took a class called "Ap computer science principles" and in that class i would always be on my phone playing roblox and not paying any attention to what the teacher was telling me. i cheated one every test and passed with a 98 as my final grade. The next year i took a course called ap CSA and i also cheated on everything and finished with a high grade but i knew nothing about coding. So a week ago i decided to take a course on udemy and now i am doing a resume for the future.</p>
